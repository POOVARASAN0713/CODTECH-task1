Project Overview: Basic Calculator in Java
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee67be78-a085-4d51-8f67-603ffbd5669f)

This project is a Basic Calculator implemented in Java. It is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program interacts with the user through the console, making it easy to input numbers, choose an operation, and view the result.


Objectives:
User Interaction: Provide an interface for users to input numbers and select an operation.
Perform Calculations: Carry out basic arithmetic operations based on the user’s choice.
Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs (like division by zero) gracefully and display error messages.
Educational Purpose: Help beginners understand core Java concepts like input handling, control structures, and arithmetic operations.

Features:

Menu-Driven Interface:

The user is presented with a menu to choose from four operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

Input Handling:

Accepts two numbers as input from the user.
Reads the user’s choice for the operation.
Arithmetic Operations:

Uses a switch statement to determine and execute the selected operation.

Error Messages:

Displays a custom message for invalid choices (e.g., selecting a number outside 1-4).
Prevents division by zero by displaying an error message when applicable.

Friendly Output:

Displays the result of the operation in a clear and user-friendly format.

Java Concepts Used:

Input Handling: Using the Scanner class to read input from the user.

Control Structures:

switch statement for operation selection.
Conditional statements to check for invalid inputs (like division by zero).
Arithmetic Operators: 
Addition (+)
subtraction (-)
multiplication (*)
division (/).

Error Handling: Preventing invalid operations and informing the user.

Use Case:
Input Example:
First Number: 10
Second Number: 5
Operation Choice: 1 (Addition)

Output Example:

Display: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

Applications:
Learning Project: Ideal for beginners to understand programming fundamentals in Java.
Practical Use: A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
Benefits:
Ease of Use: Intuitive prompts and error messages.
Educational Value: Demonstrates how to build a basic program using Java.
Extensibility: Can be expanded to include more operations like modulus, power, or trigonometric functions.
